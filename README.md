# Xircus Composer and Designer

Created by Developer for Developers with ❤️

As a developer, I've been dreaming of a platform where people can visually materialize their thoughts and concepts. The web3 gives us the power to own the web, store our websites permanently and make it accessible forever!

Xircus creates two(2) application tools to help web3 enthusiasts and developers to fully customize, create and sell, or share unique and designed-focus user interfaces. The **composer** and the **designer** are created using Chakra UI to make the build file smaller and compact. Both these tools utilizes the Xircus Web3 SDKs that allows you to connect and interact with our distribution blockchain networks, wallet providers and external thirdparty partners and platforms. Developers can use the free templates to create custom skins and custom blocks for the Xircus app community and ecosystem. The composer generates a JSON file that contains the configuration data of the pages and blocks, which can be stored permanently to distributed file system like IPFS and Arweave and can be hosted as a decentralized single page web application which can be accessible and available forever!
